            <p>I'm a first year computer science major at UCLA interested in digital media, particularly video games. I've been involved with ACM Studio, UCLA's game development club, since the summer, and I'm currently  one of the club's officers!
                In my free time (or more accurately, when I'm procrastinating), I like <a href="art.html">drawing</a>, playing video games, and occasionally running.
            </p>

                I am a new cartographer, and having this class as my introduction to mapmaking has been important in dismantling the preconceptions I had about maps before. I want to facililate the creation of maps that center community voices. 
                The project my group is working on emphasizes tenants' rights with consideration of the many different languages people speak in Los Angeles.
