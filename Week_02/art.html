            <h1>Art</h1>
            <p>I mainly do digital art of characters I like from games! There is zero stylistic consistency; I just draw however I feel like drawing.</p>
            
            <h2>Pokémon</h2>
            <p>My favorite Pokémon is actually Arcanine which I...never draw for some reason.</p>
                <img src="images/mhaexegg_final.png", alt="Concept art page of Alolan Exeggutor redesigned as a Monster Hunter boss">
                <p>Alolan Exeggutor redesigned as a Monster Hunter boss. It's my Zoom background so I have an easy fun fact about myself to share.</p>
                
                <img src="images/shinymray.png">
                <p>Shiny Rayquaza done with the polygonal lasso tool. It was supposed to be a redraw of a <a href="images/old_mray.png">shiny Mega Rayquaza I drew in 8th grade</a>, but I forgot I drew the mega version.</p>
                
                <img src="images/krok.png">
                <p>Krokorok drawn with the polygonal lasso tool as a gift for a friend.</p>

                <img src="images/jasyun-with-sig.png">
                <p>Flareon and Torchic cuddling, drawn as a donation commission.</p>
                
                <img src="images/gatorade_and_james.png">
                <p>My dear Coalossal James and Gallade Gatorade would constantly fight when I went camping in Pokémon Sword. The background is very lazy HAHAHA.</p>
                
                <img src="images/rowlets.png", alt="Dabbing Rowlet and distressed Rowlet">
                <p>A dabbing Rowlet and a distressed Rowlet, drawn as a gift for a friend.</p>

            <h2>Gacha degeneracy</h2>
            <p>I do not spend a single cent on these predatory games, but I am unfortunately still giving them a lot of my time...</p>
                
                <img src="images/hutao.PNG">
                <p>Hu Tao from Genshin Impact is very cute and very powerful and has a fun personality, so I made this drawing of her as an offering to RNGsus. It worked!</p>

                <img src="images/Beidou.png">
                <p>Beidou from Genshin Impact in a sea of lights. I was experimenting with painting for the ~vibes~ rather than detail and accuracy...so it looks really bad blown-up like this.</p>

                <img src="images/weedy_new_year.jpg">
                <p>Weedy from Arknights yeeting away the old year, drawn to as an offering to RNGsus, who was <a href="images/weedy_sadge.jpg">cruel to me</a>...though I did get her in the end. The text on the top is happy new year in Chinese!

                <p>Texas from Arknights w/ pose based off some screenshot of Nishinoya from Haikyuu.</p>
