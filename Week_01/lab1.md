   -  What fields you used
   I created the new field "ASIAN_PROP", which represents what fractional proportion of a population is Asian. I divided "ASIAN_POP" by "TOTAL_POP" to get this.
   -  Why you used these fields
   I decided to use those fields because didn't want to create the same new fields we did during class, and this class is an Asian American studies class anyway.
   -  What problems could the data set have
   I don't know anything about the source of the data.
